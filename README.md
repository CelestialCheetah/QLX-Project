# QLX-Project
A simple Project with basic analysis/linear regression.

```python:
Pandas as pd
```

This was a project I chose since it best alligned with my career goals. It is a analytics project where I attmpted to solve the problem of futures sales of sports tickest 
post Covid. I had a few issues along the way that were not the issues I had expected, but I did have issues that I also expected as well!
The largest issue I had was trying to collect the data, I have various CSV's in the project because of that. It would have been smarter to make a web scrapper to 
collect the data truthfully, but I did get the data even if it was the copy and paste way. 

This actually lead on to another issue which was from the copy and pasting. Some how the values copied into the CSV's were valued differently.
Some values were made into integers while others were made into comments. I am not sure what it was specifically that had caused it, but I am sure the copy and 
pasting was part of that. Overall I learned a good bit and sometimes simpler can be better.

# Attendance numbers
Here are the attendance numbers I gathered. I wish I could have added more values overall, but my copy and paste method has its faults haha.

# Heatmap 
Here is a heatmap, it is in a 1:1 ratio since the predictive side of the project did not go as smoothly as I wanted.

# Actaul vs Predicted
Again this will be a 1:1 ratio, more importantly for me is that I got the code correct.
